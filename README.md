# VIEWS API (v.0.3)

This repository documents the VIEWS API. It is written in `Python/FastAPI` and as such conforms to the OpenAPI standard. The API currently returns JSON, with all data currently being row-based and row-indexed (an array of observations, where each observation is its own array; not an array of columns).

The VIEWS API is available in _alpha_ testing mode at [https://api.viewsforecasting.org](https://api.viewsforecasting.org).
